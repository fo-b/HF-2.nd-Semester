# :exclamation: Planning

## Time schedule

The only time schedule that I actually use for this project is the roadmap in GitHub. The roadmap is similar to a GANT diagram.

## Resource plan

| Name, First name | Roles                      |
|-----------------|-----------------------------|
| Beti, Fabio      | Project owner & manager    |  
| Rohr, Phillip    | Expert & Project management|   
| Doerzbach, Armin | Expert FAAS / IAC          | 

<br>

The resource plan delineates the assigned roles for each team member. In my capacity as the project manager, I am actively involved in the practical implementation and serve as the primary point of contact. Additionally, Philipp Rohr serves as the designated contact for any questions or issues related to project management, while Armin Doerzbach specializes in IAC, FAAS and as the project's expert.

## SWOT analysis

![SWOT](/img/swot.png)

The SWOT analysis highlights strengths in Python development, a passion for automation, and detailed AWS documentation. A potential weakness is single-language proficiency. Opportunities include streamlining EC2 provisioning with Lambda and SQS, requiring enhanced Python skills and exploring new AWS services. Security concerns and rapid tech evolution are threats. Strategies involve continuous learning, collaboration, and a security focus. Diversifying language skills and exploring multilingual Lambda functions address weaknesses and leverage opportunities.

## Budget

I have effectively managed my costs as I am currently only working within the AWS Academy Lab, where I haven't incurred any expenses.
